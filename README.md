INST126 Final Project - Webscraping Word Counter
by Kevin Pham

For my final project, I decided to created a webscraping word counter program. This program allows users to select a website that they would like to pull information from and count how many times a specific word occurs in that website. It is fairly simple program that utilizes BeautifulSoup4. 

This project satisfies the following items:
Advanced Topic: Wenscraping and JSON
- Item 10.1: You found a simple web page and described what data you wanted to scrape from it.
- Item 10.2: You used bs4 to scrape a simple web page.
- Item 10.3: You used ’polite’ code to scrape a web page and described your approach.

Advanced Topic: Git
- Item 9.1: You created a git repo.
- Item 9.2: You added and committed at least 3 separate commits, with meaningful commit messages.
- Item 9.3: You published a repo on a remote site like GitHub.
- Item 9.4: You cloned a git repo and committed your own changes.
- Item 9.5: You submitted a complete git repo or link to a git repo to submit your work.

How To Use:
1. You will be prompted by a message that reads: "What website would you like to webscrape from?" Please copy and paste the url to a website you would like to webscrape from.
2. You will then be prompted by a message that reads: "Please enter the specific word you would like to count from this wesbite". Please enter a specific word you would like to count on the website. 
3. The program will then request the website, parse its HTML content, and count the specific word, displaying the message:"The word '______' appears ______ times on the website!"
4. If the website request is unsuccessful, you will receive a message that reads: "Uh Oh! We were unable to request the website you wanted. Status code: __________". Please run the program again.
